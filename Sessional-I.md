# Week 01, Lecture 1: Introduction to Technical Writing

## What is Technical Communication?
- Oral and written communication focused on business and industry
- Concentrates on products and services - manufacturing, marketing, management, delivery, and usage
- Primarily composed in work environments for various stakeholders

## Differences Between General and Technical Communication

| General Communication | Technical Communication |
|----------------------|-------------------------|
| General message | Technical message |
| Informal style | Mostly formal |
| No set pattern | Follows set patterns |
| Mostly oral | Both oral and written |
| Not always for specific audience | Always for specific audience |
| No technical vocabulary/graphics | Uses jargon and graphics |
| Often emotional/subjective | Logical, rational, and objective |

## Technical vs. Business Writing

| Technical Writing | Business Writing |
|------------------|------------------|
| Deals with science, engineering, technology | Any other workplace writing except journalism/creative |
| Documents: specifications, manuals, research papers | Documents: reports, emails, proposals, letters |
| Tends to be neutral and objective | Some documents need to be persuasive |

## Importance of Technical Communication
- Maintains customer-client relations
- Ensures timely work completion
- Provides documentation of completed work
- Generates income through marketing materials
- Enables quick work-related updates
- Supports equipment functionality through documentation
- Ensures correct equipment purchases
- Facilitates various forms of workplace communication

## Major Traits of Technical Communication
1. **Audience-Centered**: Has definite purposes and enhances relationships
2. **Purpose-Driven**: Clear objectives and goals
3. **Action-Enabling**: Prepares and moves readers toward effective action
4. **Relationship-Enhancing**: Builds connections between writer and reader
5. **Community-Based**: Occurs within groups with common interests
6. **Appropriate**: Community-appropriate material, word choice, and tone
7. **Interactive**: Engages readers in dialogue
8. **Well-Designed**: Both in appearance and content
9. **Responsible**: Follows ethical principles
10. **Global**: Considers worldwide context and audiences

## Ethics in Technical Communication
- Technical communication requires ethical behavior
- Communicators must care for their audience
- Should do what's right regardless of cost
- Act for the greatest good for the greatest number

## Ethical and Legal Considerations
- Avoid: plagiarism, omitting information, misquoting, misrepresenting data
- Distinguish between ethical dilemmas and ethical lapses
- Business communication is governed by laws ensuring accurate messages
- Legal areas include: contracts, employment, intellectual property, financial reporting

## Class Activity
Students were asked to identify communities they belong to and explain how their writing enables community members to act, with focus on word choice, format, and sequencing decisions.

# Week 02, Lecture 1: Technical Communication Style

## Introduction to Technical Communication Style
This lecture covers key aspects of creating effective technical writing through proper sentence strategies, paragraph clarity, and globalization considerations.

## Sentence Strategies
1. **Active Voice**: Emphasizes the performer of the action (subject-verb-object pattern)
   - Example: "I wrote the report" instead of "The report was written by me"
   - Use passive voice only when appropriate (when no agent needed, to avoid accusations, or to emphasize specific elements)

2. **Parallelism**: Use similar structure for similar elements
   - Example: "Coming in early, cooking on the front line, training employees, and taking inventory"

3. **Limit "There Are" Constructions**: These weaken meaning by burying the subject
   - Ineffective: "There is a change in policy that could increase profits"
   - Effective: "Our profits will increase if we change our policy"

4. **Avoid Nominalizations**: Don't overuse verbs turned into nouns with suffixes like -ion, -ity, -ment
   - These weaken sentences by making active concepts static

5. **Put Main Ideas First**: Structure sentences to lead with key information

6. **Control Sentence Length**: Aim for 12-25 words per sentence
   - Break longer sentences into multiple shorter ones for clarity

7. **Use "You" Correctly**: 
   - Avoid in formal reports
   - Use to mean "the reader," not as a substitute for "I" or other pronouns

8. **Eliminate Sexist Language**: 
   - Avoid language suggesting only one gender when both are intended
   - Solutions include using infinitives, plurals, or gender-neutral constructions

# Week 02, Lecture 2: Technical Communication Style (Part II)

## Common Clarity Errors
This lecture focuses on three common issues affecting clarity in technical writing:
1. Choppy sentences
2. Wordiness and redundancy
3. Strings of nouns

## Avoiding Choppy Sentences
- A series of short, independent sentences creates choppiness
- This deemphasizes important ideas
- Solution: Combine subordinate ideas into more complex sentences

**Example:**
- Choppy: "Both models offer safety belts. Both models have counterbalancing. Each one has a horn..."
- Clear: "Both models offer safety belts, counterbalancing, a horn, and lights. Only one offers wing-sided seats, which enhance safety."

## Eliminating Wordiness and Redundancy
- Avoid unnecessary subordinate clauses
- Remove redundant intensifiers
- Eliminate unnecessary repetition
- Reduce overuse of prepositions

**Examples:**
- Wordy: "It is made of very thin glass that is milky white in color."
- Concise: "It is made of thin, milky white glass."

## Avoiding Noun Clusters
- Noun clusters are three or more nouns joined in a phrase
- These make reading difficult and should be broken up

## Technology Demands Conciseness
Various formats require brevity:
- Resumes: One page (55 lines, 70-80 characters per line)
- Email: About 20 lines of text
- Mobile messages: Limited by screen size
- Online help screens: Limited by screen dimensions
- PowerPoint slides: Content must fit within slide space
- Twitter and instant messages: Character limits

## Paragraph Structure
- Limit paragraphs to 4-6 typed lines or 50 words maximum
- Use the "top-down strategy" with topic sentence first
- Follow with supporting sentences that develop, explain, and support the central idea

## Additional Style Tips
- Avoid camouflage words (key words buried in unnecessary phrases)
  - Example: "With the exception of" instead of simply "except"
- Eliminate wordy phrases
  - Example: "Make an adjustment of" instead of simply "adjust"

# Week 02, Lecture 3: Technical Communication Style (Part III)

## Globalization and Style
When writing for global audiences:
- Put only one idea in each sentence
- Avoid metaphors outside readers' cultural experience
- Consider regional word choice differences (e.g., "outlet" in America vs. "socket" in UK)
- Use consistent vocabulary instead of switching to synonyms
- Balance active and passive voice
- Avoid contractions, especially in negative statements
- Use -ing and -ed forms carefully

## Choosing Appropriate Tone
Four possible tones for technical communication:

### 1. Forceful Tone
- Implies writer control or positive situation
- Uses active voice with subject-verb-object structure
- Avoids "weasel words" (possibly, maybe, perhaps)
- Example: "I have decided to implement your suggestion... This suggestion is excellent."

### 2. Passive Tone
- Implies reader has more power or situation is negative
- Avoids imperatives
- Uses passive voice
- Includes "weasel words" (very, several, quite, fairly)
- Uses longer sentences
- Avoids explicit responsibility
- Example: "The proposal has not been accepted because of several difficult issues..."

### 3. Personal Tone
- Implies equality between reader and writer
- Uses active voice
- Includes first names and personal pronouns
- Employs short sentences and contractions
- Directly questions the reader
- Examples: "Ted, thanks for that laptop suggestion. The steering committee loved it."

### 4. Impersonal Tone
- Implies writer is not important or situation is neutral
- Avoids names (especially first names)
- Omits personal pronouns
- Uses passive voice
- Employs longer sentences
- Example: "A decision to provide each employee with a laptop has been made."

## Objectives in Technical Communication
1. Ensure clarity to prevent job errors, equipment damage, or injuries
2. Use details, specify, and quantify for reader comprehension
3. Answer who, what, when, where, why, and how
4. Avoid uncommon words, legalese, and outdated terms
5. Limit passive voice constructions
6. Use short, simple words (appropriate to reader's technical knowledge)
7. Limit sentence length by removing unnecessary elements
8. Use MS Word to check readability
9. Apply different organizational patterns (spatial, chronological, etc.)
10. Evaluate for clarity, conciseness, accuracy, and organization

## Practice Activities
- Email improvement exercise comparing a poorly written attendance correction request with a properly formatted version
- Scenario exercises for writing good news and bad news messages in appropriate tones

# Week 03, Lecture 1: Audience Recognition

## Understanding Your Audience
Key questions to consider:
- Who is your audience?
- What does the reader/listener know and not know?
- What must you communicate to ensure understanding?

- **Tertiary readers**: Evaluators
- **Gatekeepers**: Supervisors

### Step 2: Identify Readers' Needs, Values, and Attitudes
- **Needs**: Information needed for action or decisions
- **Values**: Important issues, goals, or beliefs
- **Attitudes**: Emotional responses to you, your project, or company

### Step 3: Identify Contexts
- **Physical context**: Places where readers use your document
- **Mobile context**: How document will be viewed on various media
- **Economic context**: Money-related constraints
- **Ethical context**: Personal, social, environmental influences

## Audience Knowledge Levels

### High-Tech Audience
- Experts in your field
- Understand specialized jargon, acronyms, abbreviations
- Require minimal detail on procedures or theories
- Read for new technical knowledge or project updates
- Need little background information

### Low-Tech Audience
- Co-workers in other departments, bosses, subordinates
- Familiar with subject matter but need some terms defined
- Understand some abbreviations and technical concepts

### Lay Audience
- Customers and clients outside your company
- No knowledge about your field of expertise
- Don't understand in-house jargon or concepts
- Need substantial background information

### Multiple Audiences
- Documents often need to address high-tech, low-tech, and lay readers simultaneously

### Future Audiences
- Judges and juries in legal proceedings
- New employees learning from archived documents
- Accountants and auditors reviewing past work
- New managers learning workplace procedures

## Defining Terms for Different Audiences
Methods include:
- Parenthetical definitions
- In-sentence definitions
- Extended paragraph explanations
- Glossaries
- Online pop-up definitions

## Diversity Considerations
Important diversity factors:
- Gender, race/ethnicity, religion, age
- Sexual orientation, class
- Physical and mental characteristics
- Language, family issues, departmental differences

### Importance of considering diversity:
1. Legal protection requirements
2. Ethical considerations
3. Business benefits
4. Competitive advantages of diverse workforce

# Week 03, Lecture 2: Multiculturalism in Technical Communication

## Multicultural Communication Overview
- International business requires multicultural communication - sharing written/oral information between businesspeople from different countries
- According to research, 67% of professionals communicate internationally

## Guidelines for Effective Multicultural Communication

### 1. Define Acronyms and Abbreviations
- Abbreviations may not translate across languages
- Example: "sysmgr" for "system manager" works in English but not in German ("system leiter") or French ("le responsable")

### 2. Avoid Jargon and Idioms
- Industry-specific terms and cultural expressions can cause confusion

### 3. Distinguish Between Nouns and Verbs
- Computer terms often function as both (e.g., file, scroll, paste, help, boot, code)
- This dual functionality may not exist in other languages

### 4. Be Aware of Cultural Biases/Expectations
- Cultural assumptions can lead to misunderstandings

### 5. Use Slash Marks Carefully
- Clarify whether "/" means "and," "or," or "and/or"

### 6. Avoid Humor and Puns
- Humor rarely translates well across cultures

### 7. Account for Translation Space Differences
- Translations may require more or less space than the original text

### 8. Avoid Figurative Language
- Metaphors, similes, and idiomatic expressions can be misinterpreted

### 9. Be Careful with Numbers, Measurements, Date and Time
- Format conventions vary by culture (e.g., date formats, measurement systems)

### 10. Use Stylized Graphics to Represent People
- Neutral representations avoid cultural misinterpretations

## Avoiding Biased Language

### Ageist Language
- Avoid stereotypes based on age

### Language About People With Disabilities
- Use people-first language and avoid defining people by their disabilities

### Sexist Language
- Avoid ignoring or treating women as secondary
- Prevent stereotyping based on gender

#### Strategies to Avoid Sexist Language:
- Use gender-neutral pronouns
- Avoid gender-tagged nouns (e.g., "chairman" → "chairperson")

## Audience Involvement Techniques

### Personalized Tone
- Use appropriate pronouns to connect with readers
- Include names when suitable

### Reader Benefit
- Explain how your information benefits the reader
- Use positive language

**Examples:**
- Negative: "We cannot process your request. You failed to follow the printed information."
- Positive: "So that we may process your request rapidly, please fill in line 6 on the printed form."

- Negative: "We have received your letter complaining about our services."
- Positive: "Thank you for writing to us about our services."

## Activity
