# Week 02, Lecture 2: Technical Communication Style (Part II)

## Common Clarity Errors
This lecture focuses on three common issues affecting clarity in technical writing:
1. Choppy sentences
2. Wordiness and redundancy
3. Strings of nouns

## Avoiding Choppy Sentences
- A series of short, independent sentences creates choppiness
- This deemphasizes important ideas
- Solution: Combine subordinate ideas into more complex sentences

**Example:**
- Choppy: "Both models offer safety belts. Both models have counterbalancing. Each one has a horn..."
- Clear: "Both models offer safety belts, counterbalancing, a horn, and lights. Only one offers wing-sided seats, which enhance safety."

## Eliminating Wordiness and Redundancy
- Avoid unnecessary subordinate clauses
- Remove redundant intensifiers
- Eliminate unnecessary repetition
- Reduce overuse of prepositions

**Examples:**
- Wordy: "It is made of very thin glass that is milky white in color."
- Concise: "It is made of thin, milky white glass."

## Avoiding Noun Clusters
- Noun clusters are three or more nouns joined in a phrase
- These make reading difficult and should be broken up

## Technology Demands Conciseness
Various formats require brevity:
- Resumes: One page (55 lines, 70-80 characters per line)
- Email: About 20 lines of text
- Mobile messages: Limited by screen size
- Online help screens: Limited by screen dimensions
- PowerPoint slides: Content must fit within slide space
- Twitter and instant messages: Character limits

## Paragraph Structure
- Limit paragraphs to 4-6 typed lines or 50 words maximum
- Use the "top-down strategy" with topic sentence first
- Follow with supporting sentences that develop, explain, and support the central idea

## Additional Style Tips
- Avoid camouflage words (key words buried in unnecessary phrases)
  - Example: "With the exception of" instead of simply "except"
- Eliminate wordy phrases
  - Example: "Make an adjustment of" instead of simply "adjust"
