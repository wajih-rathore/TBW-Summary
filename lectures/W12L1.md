# Week 12, Lecture 1: Creating and Using Graphics

## Introduction
Visual elements serve as "access points" where readers enter documents or engage with presentations

## Guidelines for Using Graphics

### 1. A Graphic Should Tell a Simple Story
- At a glance, readers should understand what the graphic or photograph is communicating
- Visual elements should convey clear, straightforward messages

### 2. A Graphic Should Reinforce the Written Text, Not Replace It
- Graphics should support and enhance textual information
- Example: "As shown in Graph 2, the number of high school students who report being in fights has been declining."

### 3. A Graphic Should Be Ethical
- Graphs, charts, tables, illustrations, and photographs should not:
  - Hide information
  - Distort facts
  - Exaggerate trends

### 4. A Graphic Should Be Labeled and Placed Properly
- Proper labeling and placement help readers navigate between text and images

#### Labeling Guidelines
- X and Y axes should display standard units of measurement
- Table columns and rows should be clearly labeled
- Important features in drawings should be identified with arrows or explanatory text
- Data sources should be clearly identified (underneath, in margin, or above graphic)

## Types of Graphics for Data Display

### Line Graphs
- Purpose: Show trends and relationships between variables
- X-axis represents independent variable
- Y-axis represents dependent variable
- Drawback: Cannot present exact numerical data

### Bar Charts
- Purpose: Show quantities for visual comparison among measurements
- Effective for comparing values across categories

### Tables
- Require proper labeling (number and title typically above)
- Citation of source information beneath when needed
- Best practices:
  - Use small tables focusing on specific information
  - Move larger tables to appendices to avoid "clogging" documents

### Pie Charts
- Purpose: Show how a whole divides into parts
- Use sparingly (require significant space for limited data)
- Key requirement: telling a clear story

### Flowcharts
- Purpose: Guide readers through decisions, actions, or steps
- Particularly helpful for illustrating instructions
- Visual representation of processes

## Using Photos and Drawings

### Photographs
- Particularly useful when:
  - Readers may be unfamiliar with something
  - Showing the condition of something

#### Photography Tips
- Rule of Thirds: Place focal point at intersection of thirds
- Capture people in action, close up
- When photographing places, include people for action and scale

### Illustrations
- Line drawings and diagrams: Semi-realistic illustrations of subjects
- Icons and clipart: Serve as signposts to help locate important information
- Use clipart sparingly and only when it contributes meaningfully

## Using Transcultural Symbols

### Guidelines for Cross-Cultural Visual Communication
- Keep human icons simple
- Use hand signals carefully
- Avoid culture-specific icons
- Avoid religious symbols
