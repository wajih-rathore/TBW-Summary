# Week 02, Lecture 1: Technical Communication Style

## Introduction to Technical Communication Style
This lecture covers key aspects of creating effective technical writing through proper sentence strategies, paragraph clarity, and globalization considerations.

## Sentence Strategies
1. **Active Voice**: Emphasizes the performer of the action (subject-verb-object pattern)
   - Example: "I wrote the report" instead of "The report was written by me"
   - Use passive voice only when appropriate (when no agent needed, to avoid accusations, or to emphasize specific elements)

2. **Parallelism**: Use similar structure for similar elements
   - Example: "Coming in early, cooking on the front line, training employees, and taking inventory"

3. **Limit "There Are" Constructions**: These weaken meaning by burying the subject
   - Ineffective: "There is a change in policy that could increase profits"
   - Effective: "Our profits will increase if we change our policy"

4. **Avoid Nominalizations**: Don't overuse verbs turned into nouns with suffixes like -ion, -ity, -ment
   - These weaken sentences by making active concepts static

5. **Put Main Ideas First**: Structure sentences to lead with key information

6. **Control Sentence Length**: Aim for 12-25 words per sentence
   - Break longer sentences into multiple shorter ones for clarity

7. **Use "You" Correctly**: 
   - Avoid in formal reports
   - Use to mean "the reader," not as a substitute for "I" or other pronouns

8. **Eliminate Sexist Language**: 
   - Avoid language suggesting only one gender when both are intended
   - Solutions include using infinitives, plurals, or gender-neutral constructions
