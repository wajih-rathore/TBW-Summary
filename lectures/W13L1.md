# Technical Descriptions and Process Analyses

## Introduction
Technical descriptions and process analyses are essential elements of technical communication that serve distinct but related purposes. This lecture explores their definitions, types, and the criteria for creating effective technical content.

## Technical Descriptions Defined
A technical description is a part-by-part depiction of the components of a mechanism, tool, or piece of equipment. These descriptions are critical components in various types of technical communication.

## Types of Technical Descriptions

### Operations Manuals
- Help end-users construct, install, operate, and service equipment
- Contain technical descriptions to explain equipment components

### Product Demand Specifications
- Created when a company needs equipment that doesn't currently exist
- Specifies exact needs for acquiring custom equipment

### Study Reports from Consulting Firms
- Produced when companies hire consulting engineering firms to study problems
- Provide descriptive analyses that can form the basis for product demand specifications
- Used to request solutions to identified problems

### Construction Design
- Architectural companies must clarify construction designs for cities and clients
- Requires legal technical descriptions of property limits (location and dimensions)
- Technical descriptions and graphics are used for:
  - Presentations to city councils or homeowner's associations
  - Requests for zoning changes
  - Special use permit applications
  - Re-platting sites when property lines need relocation

### Sales Literature
- Companies use technical descriptions to market equipment or services
- Common in sales letters, proposals, and websites

## Process Analysis Defined
- Comparable to instructions but with a different focus
- Instructions explain how to do something (step-by-step)
- Process analysis focuses on how something works rather than how to do something
- Examples include explaining:
  - How viruses attack bodies
  - How airbags save lives
  - How metal detectors work
  - How email messages are transmitted

### Applications of Process Analysis
Process analyses are used in various fields including:
- Engineering
- Automotive sales
- Biomedical technology

## Criteria for Writing Technical Descriptions and Process Analyses

### Title
- Must precisely state the topic
- Includes the name of the mechanism, tool, piece of equipment, landform, product, or service

### Overall Organization
- Introduction:
  - Specify and define your topic
  - Explain the topic's functions, capabilities, or processes
  - Can include a list of components, parts, or equipment
- Discussion:
  - Provides details
  - Uses appropriate word usage
  - Follows a logical organizational pattern
- Conclusion:
  - Summarizes key points

### Highlighting Techniques
Various visual elements can enhance technical descriptions:
- Line drawings
- Schematics
- CAD/CAM drawings
- Photographs
- Architectural renderings
- Clip art
- Exploded views
- Sectional cutaway views

Each visual should be accompanied by callouts (labels identifying key components).
