# Week 12, Lecture 2: Designing Documents and Interfaces

## Five Principles of Document Design
1. Balance
2. Alignment
3. Grouping
4. Consistency
5. Contrast

## Design Principle 1: Balance

### Concept
- Symmetry isn't the goal
- Establish visual equilibrium: add left - add right, add top - add bottom
- Balanced pages feel more stable and comfortable
- Unbalanced pages create tension

### Weighting Guidelines
Elements vary in visual "weight":
- Items on the right side weigh more than items on the left
- Items at the top weigh more than items at the bottom
- Large items weigh more than small items
- Pictures and graphics weigh more than text
- Colored items weigh more than black-and-white items
- Items with borders weigh more than those without

### Using Grids for Balance
- Divide the page vertically into two or more columns
- Helps distribute content evenly across the page

## Design Principle 2: Alignment

### Purpose
Uses alignment strategies to add visual structure to text

### Types of Alignment
- **Vertical alignment**: Helps readers identify different levels of information
- **Horizontal alignment**: Connects elements visually so readers view them as a unit

### Alignment Guidelines
- Alignment takes advantage of readers' tendency to search for visual relationships
- Centering works for headings but can make text look chaotic when overused
- Use margins, indentation, lists, headings, and graphics to create 2-3 levels in text
- Technical documents are usually left-aligned
- Right alignment is rare (limited to some titles and headings)
- Use centering only for titles

## Design Principle 3: Grouping

### Concept
- Group related items to highlight relationships
- Items in close proximity will be seen as one unit

### Using White Space
- Divide text into scannable blocks
- Types of white space:
  - Margins
  - Space around lists
  - Area between images and body text
  - Space between paragraphs

### Using Headings
- Maintain consistency in typeface across heading levels
- Vary only in font size and style (bold, italics, small caps)
- Use consistent wording patterns

### Using Borders and Rules
- **Borders**: Completely frame parts of the document
- **Rules**: Used to highlight banners or divide documents into sections

## Design Principle 4: Consistency

### Purpose
Creates uniformity in document or interface design

### Application Areas
- Headings should be predictable
- Pages should follow the same grid
- Lists should use consistent bulleting or numbering
- Page numbers should appear in the same location

### Typography Guidelines
- Limit document to no more than two typefaces
- Serif fonts appear formal and traditional
- Sans serif fonts seem more informal and progressive
- A combination can be effective

### Consistent Elements
- Graphics labeling
- Sequential (numbered) and nonsequential (bulleted) lists

## Design Principle 5: Contrast

### Purpose
- Adds energy and definition to page design or screen interface
- Makes different elements look distinctly different

## Transcultural Design Considerations

### Approaches
- **Culturally deep**: Incorporates language, symbols, and conventions of target culture
- **Culturally shallow**: Follows Western design conventions with adjustments for target culture preferences

### Elements to Consider
- Use of color (cultural meanings vary)
- Depiction of people
- Symbol usage
- Reading direction (left-to-right vs. right-to-left)

### Recommendation
Unless targeting specific nations/cultures, documents should be culturally shallow to work across various cultures
