# Developing and Delivering Business Presentations

## Introduction
This lecture covers Chapters 16 and 17 on developing and delivering business presentations. Presentations give you the opportunity to showcase all your communication skills, from audience analysis and research to the design of presentation materials to public speaking. Through effective presentations, you can demonstrate essential business acumen that executives look for when identifying talent for promotion.

## Body Language in Presentations
- Communication coach Gina Barnett emphasizes that the performance makes or breaks a presentation
- All business professionals can learn to use their bodies effectively when presenting
- Being mindful of physical habits and mannerisms improves your effectiveness as a speaker
- A body-mindful approach helps control anxiety and harnesses energy for a more engaging experience
- The physical act of smiling can:
  - Trigger positive mood improvements
  - Help audiences connect with you
  - Convey confidence
  - Release facial tension and improve vocal clarity
- Think of your body as a communication instrument and learn to use it to its full potential

## Planning a Presentation
Preparing a professional business presentation takes time. Nancy Duarte suggests:
- For a 1-hour presentation with 30 slides, allow 36 to 90 hours to prepare
- Following the three-step process helps ensure success:
  1. **Plan**: Analyze the situation, gather information, choose medium, organize information
  2. **Write**: Adapt to audience, compose your presentation
  3. **Complete**: Revise, master delivery, prepare to speak, overcome anxiety

### Analyzing the Situation
- Define your purpose (inform, persuade, or collaborate)
- Develop an audience profile including their emotional states
- Consider the circumstances of your presentation:
  - Venue size and setup
  - Seating arrangements (classroom, conference table, horseshoe, caf√©)
  - Environmental factors that may affect your delivery

### Selecting Media and Channels
- Options range from in-person presentations to webcasts, screencasts, or twebinars
- Match the tool to the task based on your specific needs

### Organizing a Presentation
- **Linear presentations** follow a fixed path from start to finish
- **Nonlinear presentations** can move between topics and levels of detail in any order

#### Define Your Main Idea
- Create a one-sentence summary linking subject and purpose to your audience
- Base your purpose on clear understanding of audience needs

#### Limit Your Scope
- Stay within time constraints
- Help audience retain key points
- Practice to confirm timing (3-4 minutes per slide as a rough guide)

#### Choose Your Approach
- For short presentations (under 10 minutes):
  - Use direct approach for routine information/good news
  - Use indirect approach for negative news/persuasion
- For longer presentations:
  - Organize like reports with structures based on importance, sequence, chronology, etc.
  - Adapt based on audience receptivity

## Crafting Presentation Content

### Adapting to Your Audience
- Consider audience size, venue, subject, purpose, budget, and time constraints
- For small groups: Use casual style to encourage participation
- For large audiences: Establish more formal atmosphere
- Adapt content for audiences from other cultures

### Developing Your Presentation
- **Introduction**: Arouse interest, build credibility, preview your message
- **Body**: Connect ideas with transitions, hold audience attention
- **Close**: Restate main points, end with clarity and confidence

## Delivering a Presentation

### Choosing Your Presentation Method
- **Memorizing**: Not recommended for entire presentations, but useful for opening/closing remarks
- **Reading**: Only for critical policy statements or legal documents
- **Speaking from outline/notes**: Most effective for nearly all presentations
- **Impromptu speaking**: When unexpectedly called upon to present

### Practicing Your Delivery
- Builds confidence and professionalism
- Verifies operation of visuals and equipment
- Helps maintain conversational tone

### Preparing to Speak
- Visit the location in advance if possible
- Check seating arrangements and equipment
- Consider using an interpreter for international audiences

### Overcoming Anxiety
- Put yourself in a positive frame of mind
- Focus on your knowledge of the material
- Practice thoroughly
- Visualize success
- Use breathing techniques to remain calm
- Be comfortable in your attire
- Maintain eye contact with friendly audience members

### Handling Questions Responsively
- Anticipate likely questions
- Pay attention to nonverbal signals
- Repeat questions to confirm understanding
- Offer direct answers or follow-up if you don't have complete information
- Stay in control of the presentation

## The Backchannel in Presentations
- The backchannel is communication created by audience members during presentations via Twitter or other media
- Embrace the backchannel by:
  - Integrating social media into your presentation
  - Monitoring feedback
  - Reviewing comments to improve future presentations
  - Automatically tweeting key points
  - Establishing clear expectations with the audience

## Online Presentations
For successful online presentations:
- Send preview materials ahead of time
- Rehearse using the system live
- Keep presentation simple and clear
- Ask for feedback frequently
- Consider the viewing experience from the audience's perspective
- Allow extra time for everyone to get connected

## Conclusion
Successful presentations combine careful planning, audience-focused content delivery, and effective use of technology. Remember that the most important aspect is ensuring your audience receives, understands, and embraces your message.
