# Week 03, Lecture 2: Multiculturalism in Technical Communication

## Multicultural Communication Overview
- International business requires multicultural communication - sharing written/oral information between businesspeople from different countries
- According to research, 67% of professionals communicate internationally

## Guidelines for Effective Multicultural Communication

### 1. Define Acronyms and Abbreviations
- Abbreviations may not translate across languages
- Example: "sysmgr" for "system manager" works in English but not in German ("system leiter") or French ("le responsable")

### 2. Avoid Jargon and Idioms
- Industry-specific terms and cultural expressions can cause confusion

### 3. Distinguish Between Nouns and Verbs
- Computer terms often function as both (e.g., file, scroll, paste, help, boot, code)
- This dual functionality may not exist in other languages

### 4. Be Aware of Cultural Biases/Expectations
- Cultural assumptions can lead to misunderstandings

### 5. Use Slash Marks Carefully
- Clarify whether "/" means "and," "or," or "and/or"

### 6. Avoid Humor and Puns
- Humor rarely translates well across cultures

### 7. Account for Translation Space Differences
- Translations may require more or less space than the original text

### 8. Avoid Figurative Language
- Metaphors, similes, and idiomatic expressions can be misinterpreted

### 9. Be Careful with Numbers, Measurements, Date and Time
- Format conventions vary by culture (e.g., date formats, measurement systems)

### 10. Use Stylized Graphics to Represent People
- Neutral representations avoid cultural misinterpretations

## Avoiding Biased Language

### Ageist Language
- Avoid stereotypes based on age

### Language About People With Disabilities
- Use people-first language and avoid defining people by their disabilities

### Sexist Language
- Avoid ignoring or treating women as secondary
- Prevent stereotyping based on gender

#### Strategies to Avoid Sexist Language:
- Use gender-neutral pronouns
- Avoid gender-tagged nouns (e.g., "chairman" â†’ "chairperson")

## Audience Involvement Techniques

### Personalized Tone
- Use appropriate pronouns to connect with readers
- Include names when suitable

### Reader Benefit
- Explain how your information benefits the reader
- Use positive language

**Examples:**
- Negative: "We cannot process your request. You failed to follow the printed information."
- Positive: "So that we may process your request rapidly, please fill in line 6 on the printed form."

- Negative: "We have received your letter complaining about our services."
- Positive: "Thank you for writing to us about our services."
