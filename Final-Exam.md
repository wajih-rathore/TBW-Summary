# Week 12, Lecture 1: Creating and Using Graphics

## Introduction
Visual elements serve as "access points" where readers enter documents or engage with presentations

## Guidelines for Using Graphics

### 1. A Graphic Should Tell a Simple Story
- At a glance, readers should understand what the graphic or photograph is communicating
- Visual elements should convey clear, straightforward messages

### 2. A Graphic Should Reinforce the Written Text, Not Replace It
- Graphics should support and enhance textual information
- Example: "As shown in Graph 2, the number of high school students who report being in fights has been declining."

### 3. A Graphic Should Be Ethical
- Graphs, charts, tables, illustrations, and photographs should not:
  - Hide information
  - Distort facts
  - Exaggerate trends

### 4. A Graphic Should Be Labeled and Placed Properly
- Proper labeling and placement help readers navigate between text and images

#### Labeling Guidelines
- X and Y axes should display standard units of measurement
- Table columns and rows should be clearly labeled
- Important features in drawings should be identified with arrows or explanatory text
- Data sources should be clearly identified (underneath, in margin, or above graphic)

## Types of Graphics for Data Display

### Line Graphs
- Purpose: Show trends and relationships between variables
- X-axis represents independent variable
- Y-axis represents dependent variable
- Drawback: Cannot present exact numerical data

### Bar Charts
- Purpose: Show quantities for visual comparison among measurements
- Effective for comparing values across categories

### Tables
- Require proper labeling (number and title typically above)
- Citation of source information beneath when needed
- Best practices:
  - Use small tables focusing on specific information
  - Move larger tables to appendices to avoid "clogging" documents

### Pie Charts
- Purpose: Show how a whole divides into parts
- Use sparingly (require significant space for limited data)
- Key requirement: telling a clear story

### Flowcharts
- Purpose: Guide readers through decisions, actions, or steps
- Particularly helpful for illustrating instructions
- Visual representation of processes

## Using Photos and Drawings

### Photographs
- Particularly useful when:
  - Readers may be unfamiliar with something
  - Showing the condition of something

#### Photography Tips
- Rule of Thirds: Place focal point at intersection of thirds
- Capture people in action, close up
- When photographing places, include people for action and scale

### Illustrations
- Line drawings and diagrams: Semi-realistic illustrations of subjects
- Icons and clipart: Serve as signposts to help locate important information
- Use clipart sparingly and only when it contributes meaningfully

## Using Transcultural Symbols

### Guidelines for Cross-Cultural Visual Communication
- Keep human icons simple
- Use hand signals carefully
- Avoid culture-specific icons
- Avoid religious symbols

# Week 12, Lecture 2: Designing Documents and Interfaces

## Five Principles of Document Design
1. Balance
2. Alignment
3. Grouping
4. Consistency
5. Contrast

## Design Principle 1: Balance

### Concept
- Symmetry isn't the goal
- Establish visual equilibrium: add left - add right, add top - add bottom
- Balanced pages feel more stable and comfortable
- Unbalanced pages create tension

### Weighting Guidelines
Elements vary in visual "weight":
- Items on the right side weigh more than items on the left
- Items at the top weigh more than items at the bottom
- Large items weigh more than small items
- Pictures and graphics weigh more than text
- Colored items weigh more than black-and-white items
- Items with borders weigh more than those without

### Using Grids for Balance
- Divide the page vertically into two or more columns
- Helps distribute content evenly across the page

## Design Principle 2: Alignment

### Purpose
Uses alignment strategies to add visual structure to text

### Types of Alignment
- **Vertical alignment**: Helps readers identify different levels of information
- **Horizontal alignment**: Connects elements visually so readers view them as a unit

### Alignment Guidelines
- Alignment takes advantage of readers' tendency to search for visual relationships
- Centering works for headings but can make text look chaotic when overused
- Use margins, indentation, lists, headings, and graphics to create 2-3 levels in text
- Technical documents are usually left-aligned
- Right alignment is rare (limited to some titles and headings)
- Use centering only for titles

## Design Principle 3: Grouping

### Concept
- Group related items to highlight relationships
- Items in close proximity will be seen as one unit

### Using White Space
- Divide text into scannable blocks
- Types of white space:
  - Margins
  - Space around lists
  - Area between images and body text
  - Space between paragraphs

### Using Headings
- Maintain consistency in typeface across heading levels
- Vary only in font size and style (bold, italics, small caps)
- Use consistent wording patterns

### Using Borders and Rules
- **Borders**: Completely frame parts of the document
- **Rules**: Used to highlight banners or divide documents into sections

## Design Principle 4: Consistency

### Purpose
Creates uniformity in document or interface design

### Application Areas
- Headings should be predictable
- Pages should follow the same grid
- Lists should use consistent bulleting or numbering
- Page numbers should appear in the same location

### Typography Guidelines
- Limit document to no more than two typefaces
- Serif fonts appear formal and traditional
- Sans serif fonts seem more informal and progressive
- A combination can be effective

### Consistent Elements
- Graphics labeling
- Sequential (numbered) and nonsequential (bulleted) lists

## Design Principle 5: Contrast

### Purpose
- Adds energy and definition to page design or screen interface
- Makes different elements look distinctly different

## Transcultural Design Considerations

### Approaches
- **Culturally deep**: Incorporates language, symbols, and conventions of target culture
- **Culturally shallow**: Follows Western design conventions with adjustments for target culture preferences

### Elements to Consider
- Use of color (cultural meanings vary)
- Depiction of people
- Symbol usage
- Reading direction (left-to-right vs. right-to-left)

### Recommendation
Unless targeting specific nations/cultures, documents should be culturally shallow to work across various cultures

# Developing and Delivering Business Presentations

## Introduction
This lecture covers Chapters 16 and 17 on developing and delivering business presentations. Presentations give you the opportunity to showcase all your communication skills, from audience analysis and research to the design of presentation materials to public speaking. Through effective presentations, you can demonstrate essential business acumen that executives look for when identifying talent for promotion.

## Body Language in Presentations
- Communication coach Gina Barnett emphasizes that the performance makes or breaks a presentation
- All business professionals can learn to use their bodies effectively when presenting
- Being mindful of physical habits and mannerisms improves your effectiveness as a speaker
- A body-mindful approach helps control anxiety and harnesses energy for a more engaging experience
- The physical act of smiling can:
  - Trigger positive mood improvements
  - Help audiences connect with you
  - Convey confidence
  - Release facial tension and improve vocal clarity
- Think of your body as a communication instrument and learn to use it to its full potential

## Planning a Presentation
Preparing a professional business presentation takes time. Nancy Duarte suggests:
- For a 1-hour presentation with 30 slides, allow 36 to 90 hours to prepare
- Following the three-step process helps ensure success:
  1. **Plan**: Analyze the situation, gather information, choose medium, organize information
  2. **Write**: Adapt to audience, compose your presentation
  3. **Complete**: Revise, master delivery, prepare to speak, overcome anxiety

### Analyzing the Situation
- Define your purpose (inform, persuade, or collaborate)
- Develop an audience profile including their emotional states
- Consider the circumstances of your presentation:
  - Venue size and setup
  - Seating arrangements (classroom, conference table, horseshoe, café)
  - Environmental factors that may affect your delivery

### Selecting Media and Channels
- Options range from in-person presentations to webcasts, screencasts, or twebinars
- Match the tool to the task based on your specific needs

### Organizing a Presentation
- **Linear presentations** follow a fixed path from start to finish
- **Nonlinear presentations** can move between topics and levels of detail in any order

#### Define Your Main Idea
- Create a one-sentence summary linking subject and purpose to your audience
- Base your purpose on clear understanding of audience needs

#### Limit Your Scope
- Stay within time constraints
- Help audience retain key points
- Practice to confirm timing (3-4 minutes per slide as a rough guide)

#### Choose Your Approach
- For short presentations (under 10 minutes):
  - Use direct approach for routine information/good news
  - Use indirect approach for negative news/persuasion
- For longer presentations:
  - Organize like reports with structures based on importance, sequence, chronology, etc.
  - Adapt based on audience receptivity

## Crafting Presentation Content

### Adapting to Your Audience
- Consider audience size, venue, subject, purpose, budget, and time constraints
- For small groups: Use casual style to encourage participation
- For large audiences: Establish more formal atmosphere
- Adapt content for audiences from other cultures

### Developing Your Presentation
- **Introduction**: Arouse interest, build credibility, preview your message
- **Body**: Connect ideas with transitions, hold audience attention
- **Close**: Restate main points, end with clarity and confidence

## Delivering a Presentation

### Choosing Your Presentation Method
- **Memorizing**: Not recommended for entire presentations, but useful for opening/closing remarks
- **Reading**: Only for critical policy statements or legal documents
- **Speaking from outline/notes**: Most effective for nearly all presentations
- **Impromptu speaking**: When unexpectedly called upon to present

### Practicing Your Delivery
- Builds confidence and professionalism
- Verifies operation of visuals and equipment
- Helps maintain conversational tone

### Preparing to Speak
- Visit the location in advance if possible

### Handling Questions Responsively
- Anticipate likely questions
- Pay attention to nonverbal signals
- Repeat questions to confirm understanding
- Offer direct answers or follow-up if you don't have complete information
- Stay in control of the presentation

## The Backchannel in Presentations
- The backchannel is communication created by audience members during presentations via Twitter or other media
- Embrace the backchannel by:
  - Integrating social media into your presentation
  - Monitoring feedback
  - Reviewing comments to improve future presentations
  - Automatically tweeting key points
  - Establishing clear expectations with the audience

## Online Presentations
For successful online presentations:
- Send preview materials ahead of time
- Rehearse using the system live
- Keep presentation simple and clear
- Ask for feedback frequently
- Consider the viewing experience from the audience's perspective
- Allow extra time for everyone to get connected

## Conclusion
Successful presentations combine careful planning, audience-focused content delivery, and effective use of technology. Remember that the most important aspect is ensuring your audience receives, understands, and embraces your message.

# Technical Descriptions and Process Analyses

## Introduction
Technical descriptions and process analyses are essential elements of technical communication that serve distinct but related purposes. This lecture explores their definitions, types, and the criteria for creating effective technical content.
